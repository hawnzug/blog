title: Switching from Hugo to Hakyll
---

One year ago, I built this site using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) because of the
simplicity and speed. Hugo is an awesome static site generator and it has
an active community. It's easy for anyone to build a site using Hugo with
numerous high quality themes.

Recently, however, I felt tired of changing themes over and over again and
looking up for better configuration. I spent too much time changing themes
and adding new functions, while only few articles were posted on this site.
So I switch from Hugo to Hakyll, because to some degree it's more difficult
to configure and there seems to be few existing themes. So I can focus more
on contents, and when I really need some new functions, I can also practice
my Haskell skills during modification.

Another important reason is Hakyll has tight integration with pandoc, and I
also use pandoc frequently in my daily life. So I want to keep consistent
and use pandoc to generate my blogs.

If you're reading the post, you will find this site is extremely simple, using
almost plain HTML. Last year I had some unpleasant experiences writing CSS. I
think it is too tedious and time-consuming so I vow never to write complicated
CSS by hand. I keep my promise in this site.
