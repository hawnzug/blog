## About

I'm Zhuyang Wang, a sophomore undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I am interested in Functional Programming, Programming Language and compiling.
I am a proud member of [SJTUG](http://sjtug.org), a joyful Linux user group.
I love Haskell, Rust, Python and Agda.

My favorite Linux distribution is Arch Linux. I enjoy editting in Vim, but
sometimes I have to use (Spac)Emacs to write Agda or Coq.

The word Zhu(ç«¹) in my name means bamboo in Chinese, and you may pronounce it like "drew" in English.
